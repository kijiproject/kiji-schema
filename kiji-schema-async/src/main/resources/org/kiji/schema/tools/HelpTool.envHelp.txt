ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  Users can set several environment variables to change the behavior of the kiji script and
  the tools it runs. These include:

  KIJI_HOME           Should give the path to the root of the kiji-schema distribution to
                      use when executing tools. By default, the parent of the directory
                      containing this script will be used (as this script is likely in the
                      bin directory of a kiji distribution).

  KIJI_MR_HOME        Should give the path to the root of a kiji-mapreduce distribution to
                      use when executing tools. Users should set this environment variable
                      if they wish to use tools provided as part of kiji-mapreduce.

  HADOOP_HOME         Should give the path to the root of the hadoop distribution to use
                      when executing tools. By default, /usr/lib/hadoop will be used.

  HBASE_HOME          Should give the path to the root of the hbase distribution to use
                      when executing tools. By default, /usr/lib/hbase will be used.

  KIJI_CLASSPATH      Should contain a colon-seperated list of paths to client libraries
                      to place on the classpath of run tools. This is useful for when you
                      run custom kiji programs that depend on libraries not provided by the
                      kiji system. The libraries specified in KIJI_CLASSPATH will be
                      placed first on the classpath so that they will take precedence over
                      libraries provided by the kiji system. By default KIJI_CLASSPATH is
                      empty. Note that jars in KIJI_CLASSPATH are not automatically added
                      to the distributed cache for MapReduce jobs.

                      To add jars to the distributed cache of MapReduce jobs, use the --lib
                      flag available on tools provided by kiji-mapreduce. This flag accepts
                      a path to a directory of jars to be included on the classpath of
                      MapReduce tasks. Note that library jars that are part of kiji-schema
                      and kiji-mapreduce are automatically added to the classpath of
                      MapReduce jobs run with kiji-mapreduce tools.

  KIJI_JAVA_OPTS      Should contain extra arguments to pass to the JVM used to execute
                      tools. By default, KIJI_JAVA_OPTS is empty.

  JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH   Should contain a colon-seperated list of paths to additional native
                      libraries to pass to the JVM (through the java.library.path
                      property). Note the kiji script will always pass the native libraries
                      included with your hadoop distribution to the JVM. By default
                      JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH is empty.

  KIJI_HADOOP_DISTRO_VER
                      May optionally specify a subdirectory of $KIJI_HOME/lib/distribution
                      to include on the classpath. e.g., "hadoop2". Hadoop version-specific
                      Kiji jars are typically automatically inferred by running
                      'bin/hadoop version'. You should set this environment variable only
                      if the auto-detection logic fails to recognize your Hadoop version.
