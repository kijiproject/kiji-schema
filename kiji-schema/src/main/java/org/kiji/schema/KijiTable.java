/**
 * The KijiTable interface provides operations on KijiTables. To perform reads to and
 * writes from a Kiji table use a {@link KijiTableReader} or {@link KijiTableWriter}.
 * Instances of these classes can be obtained by using the {@link #openTableReader()}
 * and {@link #openTableWriter()} methods.  {@link EntityId}s, which identify particular
 * rows within a Kiji table are also generated from its components.
 *
 * <h2>KijiTable instance lifecycle:</h2>
 * <p>
 *   To open a connection to a KijiTable, use {@link Kiji#openTable(String)}. A KijiTable
 *   contains an open connection to an HBase cluster. Because of this, KijiTable objects
 *   must be released using {@link #release()} when finished using it:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   <code>
 *     final KijiTable table = myKiji.openTable("tableName");
 *     // Do some magic
 *     table.release();
 *   </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Reading & Writing from a KijiTable:</h2>
 * <p>
 *   The KijiTable interface does not directly provide methods to perform I/O on a Kiji
 *   table. Read and write operations can be performed using either a {@link KijiTableReader}
 *   or a {@link KijiTableWriter}:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   <code>
 *     final KijiTable table = myKiji.openTable("tableName");
 *
 *     final EntityId myId = table.getEntityId("myRowKey");
 *
 *     final KijiTableReader reader = table.openTableReader();
 *     final KijiTableWriter writer = table.openTableWriter();
 *
 *     // Read some data from a Kiji table using an existing EntityId and KijiDataRequest.
 *     final KijiRowData row = reader.get(myId, myDataRequest);
 *
 *     // Do things with the row...
 *
 *     // Write some data to a new column in the same row.
 *     writer.put(myId, "info", "newcolumn", "newvalue");
 *
 *     // Close open connections.
 *     reader.close();
 *     writer.close();
 *     table.release();
 *   </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see KijiTableReader for more information about reading data from a Kiji table.
 * @see KijiTableWriter for more information about writing data to a Kiji table.
