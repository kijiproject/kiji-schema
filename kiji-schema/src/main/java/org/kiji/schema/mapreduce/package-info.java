/**
 * Kiji map-reduce utilities.
 *
 * <p>This package provides support for building map-reduce jobs that read from and/or write to
 * a Kiji table. For reading from Kiji, use {@link
 * org.kiji.schema.mapreduce.KijiTableInputFormat}. For writing to
 * kiji use {@link org.kiji.schema.mapreduce.KijiTableOutputFormat}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that this package is deprecated; the KijiMapReduce framework
 * (https://github.com/kijiproject/kiji-mapreduce) will contain revamped versions of these
 * and additional MapReduce integration points. Users investing heavily in MapReduce
 * should pay attention to development on this new project at https://jira.kiji.org and the
 * user and developer mailing lists user@ and dev@kiji.org. After KijiMapReduce is released,
 * this package will disappear.</p>
