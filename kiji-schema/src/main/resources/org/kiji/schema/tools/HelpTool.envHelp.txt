ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  Users can set several environment variables to change the behavior of the kiji script and
  the tools it runs. These include:

  KIJI_HOME           Should give the path to the root of the kiji distribution to use when
                      executing tools. By default, the parent of the directory containing
                      this script will be used (as this script is likely in the bin
                      directory of a kiji distribution).

  HADOOP_HOME         Should give the path to the root of the hadoop distribution to use
                      when executing tools. By default, /usr/lib/hadoop will be used.

  HBASE_HOME          Should give the path to the root of the hbase distribution to use
                      when executing tools. By default, /usr/lib/hbase will be used.

  KIJI_CLASSPATH      Should contain a colon-seperated list of paths to client libraries
                      to place on the classpath of run tools. This is useful for when you
                      run custom kiji programs that depend on libraries not provided by the
                      kiji system. The libraries specified in KIJI_CLASSPATH will be
                      placed first on the classpath so that they will take precedence over
                      libraries provided by the kiji system. By default KIJI_CLASSPATH is
                      empty. Note that jars in KIJI_CLASSPATH are not automatically added
                      to the distributed cache for map reduce jobs.

  KIJI_JAVA_OPTS      Should contain extra arguments to pass to the JVM used to execute
                      tools. By default, KIJI_JAVA_OPTS is empty.

  JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH   Should contain a colon-seperated list of paths to additional native
                      libraries to pass to the JVM (through the java.library.path
                      property). Note the kiji script will always pass the native libraries
                      included with your hadoop distribution to the JVM. By default
                      JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH is empty.
