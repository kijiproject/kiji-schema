                              Kiji Schema Release Notes

Version 1.0.0-rc3
  * SCHEMA-111. Adds RELEASE_NOTES.txt
  * SCHEMA-90. KijiURIException subclasses IOException.

Version 1.0.0-rc2
  * SCHEMA-93. Deprecate the org.kiji.schema.mapreduce package. This marks
      classes in this package as @Deprecated in preparation for the eventual
      release of KijiMapReduce.
  * SCHEMA-52. Initial effort at multiple Hadoop version support. While
      MapReduce code requires CDH4, non-MR-based operations provided by
      KijiSchema can be performed with both CDH4 or Apache Hadoop 1.0
      and HBase 0.92.1.
  * SCHEMA-60. Multiple platform profiles for KijiSchema. To facilitate
      multiple Hadoop version support in Kiji, your project must now
      explicitly declare a reference to the underlying Hadoop distribution.
      Specifically, put this in your pom.xml file to continue working with
      CDH4:
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.kiji.platforms</groupId>
        <artifactId>kiji-cdh4-platform</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-rc2</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
      </dependency>
      See https://github.com/kijiproject/kiji-platforms/blob/master/README.md
      for a full list of available platforms.
  * SCHEMA-7. Add metadata backup and restore tools ('kiji metadata')
  * SCHEMA-28. Removed KijiDataWrapper and its subclasses. This change
      refactors large parts of KijiSchema and has several incompatible
      changes associated with it:
      ** KijiURIs are now used more pervasively to reference Kiji instance
         and table names. KijiConfiguration is deprecated; you should open
         Kiji instances through KijiURIs.
      ** KijiCellEncoder and KijiCellDecoder were significantly revamped.
      ** KijiTable is now an interface.
      ** Interaction between Kiji, KijiTable, and KijiTableReader/Writer
         reworked. See the javadoc for the Kiji.open() and
         KijiTable.openTableReader() / openTableWriter() methods.
      ** KijiTableWriter was significantly simplified. You no longer need to
         specify the schema when writing to a cell; the schema is induced from
         the type when you write. The forms of the put() method where schemas
         are specified have been removed.
      ** KijiTableReader and KijiRowData have been significantly simplified.
         You no longer need to explicitly specify the type when you read a cell
         (e.g., via getStringValue()). Methods like getIntValue(),
         getStringValues(), etc. have been removed. Instead, a universal
         getMostRecentValue() method can now use type inference in combination
         with the default reader schema specified in the table's layout to
         deserialize the data with the correct type signature.
  * SCHEMA-40. Add audience annotations to classes. Provisional annotations
      have been added to indicate whether classes are intended for use by all
      clients, other framework modules, or only the current module.
      See github.com/kijiproject/annotations for more documentation.
      Related to this, several classes have been made 'final', to prevent end
      users from extending them.
  * SCHEMA-51. Use Kiji artifacts, not odiago/wibi artifacts.
  * SCHEMA-43. bugfix: bin-script cannot be directly symlinked.
  * SCHEMA-36. kiji-schema jar is now always added to the front of the
      classpath.
  * SCHEMA-34. Handle general exceptions more gracefully in Kiji tools.
