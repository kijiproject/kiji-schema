KijiSchema
==========

KijiSchema is a layout and schema management layer on top of Apache
HBase. KijiSchema supports complex, compound data types using Avro
serialization, as well as cell-level evolving schemas that dynamically
encode version information.

KijiSchema includes both commandline tools and a simple Java API to
manipulate tables, layouts, and data. It also provide native MapReduce
Input/Output formats for Kiji tables.

For more information about KijiSchema, see
[the Kiji project homepage](http://www.kiji.org).

Compilation
-----------

KijiSchema requires [Apache Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html) to build. It
may be built with the command

    mvn clean package

or by executing `bin/kiji` from the root of a checkout. This will create a release in the
target directory.

Installation
------------

KijiSchema requires an HBase and Hadoop cluster to run. Confirm that `$HADOOP_HOME` and
`$HBASE_HOME` are set appropriately. Then issue the following command from your KijiSchema
root directory:

    bin/kiji install

This will install a Kiji instance on the hbase cluster named 'default'.

Usage
-----

For commandline tool usage, issue the command:

    bin/kiji
